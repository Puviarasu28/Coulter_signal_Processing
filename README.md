Project Title: Processing code-multiplexed coulter signals using customized YOLOv2

This repository contains my code for training YOLOv2, an object recognition model. The code for processing code-multiplexed coulter signals using customized YOLOv2 will be added after publishing the research paper. This will be a follow-up paper to [link](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/lc/c9lc00597h)
